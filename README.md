# Image_classifier
I have implemented Image classifier which differentiates between 3 sets of images i.e. cars, dogs and ice cream cones using scikit image.
In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recogonize difference between the 3 sets of images. When you've completed this project, yoi'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labelled images.
